Description:
   Pa_qualified adds support for fully qualified module references to OCaml.
   If a module reference (in any possible context) starts with "Q.", then
   the rest of the reference denotes a context-independent globally unique
   path (as if the reference was located at the very beginning of the file).
   Qualified references can never be shadowed by other definitions
   (warranty void if "Q" is defined explicitly somewhere).
